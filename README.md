This collection refers to data used to generate all figures presented in the article “Ecological and demographic drivers of Oropouche virus transmission” accepted in Nature Health. All statistical computing analyses were conducted using RStudio, version 4.4.1 and BEAST X. R packages necessary for analysis and visualization were biscale 1.0.0, censobr 0.4.0, dplyr 1.1.4, EpiEstim 2.2-4, ggbreak 0.1.2, ggplot2 3.5.1, lubridate 1.9.3, RColorBrewer 1.1-3, readxl 1.4.3, sf 1.0-16, stringr 1.5.1, tidyverse 2.0.0, tmap 3.3-4, randomForestSRC 4.7-1.2, and stats 4.4.1. No custom code was developed in the study. Figures 4C and Figure Extend 6 were generated using BEAST X software. No custom code was developed. De-identified individual-level data from the Brazilian Ministry of Health can be provided for research purposes after approval by a committee on human experimentation (if applicable). This data can be obtained upon request to the corresponding authors (William M. de Souza, wmdesouza@uky.edu). The estimated response time from the corresponding authors may be up to three weeks.![Uploading image.png…]()
